=================

This page documents common bugs in gedit. If you find your problem in this page,
_please do not report a new bug for it_.

Problem with very long lines
----------------------------

Very long lines (e.g. a wrapped line that takes the whole screen) are not well
supported by gedit, there can be performance problems or freezes.

[GitLab issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/229). See also the
[gedit FAQ](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit/FAQ).

Windows and macOS support
-------------------------

The latest binaries of gedit available for Windows and macOS may not work
correctly on a recent version of these operating systems.

There is work in progress to have a more recent gedit version available on
Windows.
