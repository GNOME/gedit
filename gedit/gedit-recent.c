/* If a file is local, chances are that if load/save fails the file has been
 * removed and the failure is permanent so we remove it from the list of recent
 * files. For remote files the failure may be just transitory and we keep the
 * file in the list.
 *
 * FIXME: for files coming from external disks, USB keys etc, if the external
 * storage device is not mounted, do not remove the file from the list. On the
 * other hand, if the external storage device is mounted and the file isn't
 * there, remove it from the list.
 *
 * FIXME: for remote files, perhaps do the same as for external storage devices,
 * IF the connection to the server succeeds (the directory is there).
 *
 * FIXME: for the above FIXMEs, we should probably rely (in part) on the GError
 * we receive.
 * And if it was a file loading, a useful information to have is whether the
 * file was opened from the list of recent files. If it was *not*, the user can
 * also just navigate again through the file hierarchy to re-open it later if
 * the file comes back.
 *
 * IDEA: or just never remove files from the recent list, and call it the
 * Recent History or something like that.
