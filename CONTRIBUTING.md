How to contribute to gedit
==========================

gedit development relies on voluntary contributions and everyone is invited to
help.

If you are interested in helping us to improve gedit, you can contact the
developers, see the “Getting in Touch” section on the
[gedit wiki page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit).

Contributions other than software development
---------------------------------------------

See the [GNOME wiki](https://wiki.gnome.org/).

Doing **bug triaging** on the bug tracker is a very useful task for gedit,
because gedit is used by many people and there are therefore lots of bug reports
or feature requests.

Software development
--------------------

To get started with gedit development, see the file
[docs/gedit-development-getting-started.md](docs/gedit-development-getting-started.md).
