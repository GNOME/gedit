To add more info: among the currently _active_ gedit developers, I'm probably
the person who knows best the gedit code and underlying libraries. I now have
more than 700 commits on the master branch of gedit, which makes me the third
contributor in terms of number of commits. I'm also the first contributor to
GtkSourceView, the author of the gspell and Tepl libraries, the author of other
text editors apps based on GtkSourceView, and 10 years of experience in that
field (but not full-time). So I'm not a random guy adding himself as
maintainer ;-)

I will take care of gedit as best as I can if I have the time and energy, I
don't plan to remove features. I hope I will not suffer from too much stress
again, and I hope I will have enough time for all my projects with GTK-based
specialized text editors or other development tools.

Let's bring gedit to the 2020's!! with a new hope.
